# Forgotten Developer - a terminal like theme for [Frontity](https://frontity.org/). 

> The starting point of all achievement is desire.

I always had the desire to create my personal blog with my own terminal like design. This new year, Iâ€™m incredibly happy to share my terminal like theme for Frontity.
The theme is amazingly simple but unique which is dedicated to developers and geeky folks. It is minimalist and very lightweight. You could use the theme package as a starting point to build your next programming website or blog.
